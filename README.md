# CNN-RCNN

In this paper, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for the image classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The initial layer of the CNN preprocesses the dataset and employs augmentation techniques to the training data. The augmentation techniques include random rotations, shifting, zooming, and flipping the image in the dataset. To categorize the images in the dataset into ten classes under the label aircraft, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck and vehicle. The CNN model architecture is made up of convolutional, max-pooling and fully connected layers. The proposed system has been trained over 50 epochs by using binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. When tested, the model's test accuracy of 91.5 percent has been the upper limit. This study evaluates the binary classification between images classifying between real and AI generated shows how well CNNs perform image classification tasks and shows how important data augmentation is to enhancing model performance.
